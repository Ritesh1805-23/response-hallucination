# response-hallucination
Compared factual responses from ChatGPT and Claude across topics to detect hallucinations. Evaluated accuracy, consistency, and frequency of fabricated or misleading information.

#  Response Hallucination Detection (ChatGPT vs Claude)

This project investigates how often and in what ways ChatGPT and Claude generate hallucinated or fabricated responses across factual domains like science, history, and pop culture.

##  Project Overview

- **Objective**: Compare factual consistency and hallucination frequency between ChatGPT and Claude.
- **Method**: Created identical prompt sets, evaluated both model responses manually, and tagged them for hallucinations or misleading claims.
- **Focus Areas**: Science facts, historical accuracy, pop culture details.
- **Tools Used**: Manual annotation, Notion for tracking, GitHub for publishing results.

##  Key Findings

- ChatGPT showed slightly fewer hallucinations in scientific and historical prompts.
- Claude was more conversational but sometimes inferred or fabricated pop culture trivia.
- Detailed observations and test results are available in the `/results` folder.
